//    TODO: Define the following validation checks with appropriate error messages
//      1. Ensure the username is at least 6 characters long
//      2. Ensure the password is at least 10 characters long
//      3. Ensure the password and confirmation password match

// TODO: Define this function
function clearErrors() {
  // Loop through all the children of the error-list element and remove them
  // IMPORTANT: This cannot be done with a forEach loop or a normal for loop since as you remove children it will modify the list you are looping over which will not work
  // I recommend using a while loop to accomplish this task
  // This is the trickiest part of this exercise so if you get stuck and are unable to progress you can also set the innerHTML property of the error-list to an empty string and that will also clear the children. I recommend trying to accomplish this with a while loop, though, for practice.
  // Also, make sure you remove the show class to the errors container
}

// TODO: Define this function
function showErrors(errorMessages) {
  // Add each error to the error-list element
  // Make sure to use an li as the element for each error
  // Also, make sure you add the show class to the errors container
