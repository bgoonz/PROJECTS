# Introduction to Web Development

This repository contains all of the code for each individual lesson and is broken into three sections. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each section contains a folder for each lesson that contains all the code for the project as of the end of that lesson.

The code in these projects is only meant as a reference and should not be directly copied. Instead you should be creating your own web site for your own favorite musician.
